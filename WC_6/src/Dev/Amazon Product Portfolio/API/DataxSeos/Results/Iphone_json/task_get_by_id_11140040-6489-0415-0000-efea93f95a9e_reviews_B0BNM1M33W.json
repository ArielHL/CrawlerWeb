The phone has 1000% health and 50 cycles on it. There are few scratches on the buttons but none on the screen or the sides. There is visible dust in the speaker  vents on the top of the screen but it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. The touch responsiveness feels slightly off for now but luckily Amazon has a a long replacement or refund policy so I feel safe. Overall it\u2019s a great phone for the price and feels quite similar to the 15Pro max for a huge discount. The phone was in immaculate condition and the slight scratches that I mentioned are verrrryyyy slight so it\u2019s not noticeable at all if you manage to get this for \u00a3800 ish it\u2019s a steal\nEdit: I have been using this for 3 weeks and it feels great I have added a spigen screen guard and case to keep this in mint condition but the touch randomly feels non responsive( I have moved from an android device so maybe I\u2019m not used to iOS) will post an update in 6 months",

They sell them without testing them properly.\nI'll explain more here...\nWe ordered the latest iPhone, and it looks like a legitimate deal and trusted by amazon. But unfortunately its dodgy\nThe phone arrived looking (and sold as) new, but after trying multiple sims in it, it was faulty (despite being unlocked).\nAs the seller sold it as being completely tested and working, we obviously tried different network sims in it, but nothing worked.\nHaving taken it finally to an apple store they ran a 3 minute MRI test on it and not only did they find it was a fault phone that doesn't read ANY sim card you put in it, but that this fault was actually part of its history and probably the reason why it was taken back in the first place.\nMy issue is that the whole thing took weeks to sort, and we were without a phone but on a contract for the whole time. From initially being sent the phone, to trying to find out what's wrong with it, to sending it back and then waiting for them to respond.\nThe latter part of the customer service was terrible by the seller, they don't work weekends and if we didn't call them would have had no response about refunds etc from them probably. They were also non-remorseful about the situation\nThis was the first time also that we found Amazon customer service to be terrible, dismissive and rude:\nWhen we told them about the \"trusted seller\" they literally said \"well you should have bought from the official iPhone shop\"\nThere are some great refurb shops online, but this whole service is damaging the idea",
