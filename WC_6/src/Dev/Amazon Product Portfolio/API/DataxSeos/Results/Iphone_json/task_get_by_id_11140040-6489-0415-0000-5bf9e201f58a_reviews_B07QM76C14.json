We tried 2 other stools before this one and they either tipped over when she tried to climb up, or slid on the carpet so she slipped when climbing down or she slipped on the top with her footie jammies when using it and fell.\nThis stool solved ALL those issues! It is super sturdy and is wide enough overall and has wide enough legs to prevent tipping, even when your 2 year old steps one foot on the far end of the stool with all her 35 pounds of weight. Our daughter tipped a wooden stool this way and fell pretty hard, which is why I looked for this one! And I'm so glad I did!\nIt has wide rubber feet to prevent the stool from moving/sliding on the carpet or hardwood/linoleum when wiggly feet dangle down from a bed trying to reach it. And to top it off there is also rubber all over on the top of the steps (not just dots) so tiny feet in socks or footie jammies don't slip right off the stool (which is an issue with many other plastic stools).\nIt's also a large enough stool that it easily accommodates adult feet and weight. I'm pretty short and have used it when climbing into my daughter's bed to change the sheets.\nWe love this stool and highly recommend it for safely allowing tiny people to get a step up! It's perfect for tiny humans in tall beds, or potty training, or kiddo hand washing, or toddler tooth brushing, or any time the little ones need to safely climb or reach.",

Unfortunately, not only was that stool too short for our home toilet, it slipped like crazy all over our vinyl bathroom floor. Not helpful at building potty confidence! This was our second attempt, and it's perfect. It *does not move* unless you intentionally move it. Sometimes that's a pain - it's bulky, and can occasionally get in the way of the door - but if you're doing for something large and sturdy you can't exactly complain when it's... large and sturdy, right? \ud83d\ude05 My little guy loves these steps, and often brings them into the kitchen so he can help me cook. So they're big, sturdy, and still light enough for an almost-3-year-old to lug around at will - not sure what else one could ask for! We're super pleased with this purchase, and would recommend these steps to anyone.",

I read reviews and Montessori blogs all over the web. This stool is a good height in so far as my kid can actually reach the sink bowl while standing on it. Lightweight so she can move it herself (with supervision). Sturdy enough for parents to stand on. Doesn't look like a kid's toy, which means we will actually have a decent-looking white stool for adult use in the home when my child no longer needs it. Grippy non-slip treads and wide steps. And very reasonably priced. A wooden step stool would by lovely, but also heavy and expensive.\nI had my research narrowed down to this stool, a Rubbermaid step stool (only comes in black and has a huge footprint) and the Prince Lionheart UPPY2 step stool (low weight capacity meant it would only be useful for a little kid). If and when we need another stool in the house, I'll be coming right back here to buy the iLove again.",

It does not slide around easily on marble floors, which is great, that was something I was concerned about.  It holds my 35 pound grandson well, however I took off one star only because it\u2019s very difficult for him to use the potty , as he is not steady enough to be able to turn his rear to the seat,so I do have to  strictly monitor him . ( but this will get better with time :)I must closely monitor him also in the kitchen when he is at the counter helping, LOL, because he is so young he moves around without being aware of his surroundings, The stool moves of course. But all in all I am very satisfied with the stool and exceptional happy with the seller ,who reached out to me even before I receive the product...thank you for a great customer service ,it is greatly appreciated.  PS If you have a child that likes to climb things, I\u2019m sure they will enjoy this product, my grandson did not want to use the potty until he realize he had to climb up on something to get there, LOL.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",

We like that it's wider, and the depth of the steps wider, than others we looked at.  While we do hold his hand as he steps up and turns around to sit on the toilet, the extra space of the steps provides more security.  Each step is completely covered with non-skid material, while other step stools only had non-skid strips or dots.  It is harder for him to maneuver from the toilet to the sink than his smaller stool at home, but his safety was our #1 reason for purchasing this step stool (and GG is happy to move it for him!)  It cleans up easily, is holding up well, and should be in great shape when our 9-month old grandson is ready to use it!",

They quickly acted and pulled some levers to fill my order immediately, and I got it the next day!\nMy 15 month old just started using it today, and I\u2019m impressed. The plastic is thick and sturdy, and the anti-slip areas are SUPER grippy. I tried move it while he was standing on it, and it didn\u2019t even budge. I also like where they put the handles.. he can easily grab it himself and walk around with it. Great product!",

The original from 2 years ago is still great; however the second one which I bought in May cracked along the back after less than a month and is now unsafe to use. I didn't realize the crack until after the return period expired as I would have opted to get a replacement, but I guess it's off to the trash now.\nedit: updated to 5 stars for great customer service",
