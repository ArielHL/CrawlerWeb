NA,6 Aug 2023,Okay pay but great place to build your career,Customer Success Manager,"London, England","The Digital Inside Sales part of Accenture have various big name vendors outsourcing to them, for example Microsoft. You are given technical training to attain certifications, and they will pay for you to take the test. On top of that, you do the training during work hours. If you're relatively new to tech sales, the pay is great. However, if you're tenured you probably want to have more than they'll offer. WFH hybrid. You're expected to come to office twice a week (if working on Microsoft campaign). Realistic and doable targets and relatively chill atmosphere. Colleagues are nice and supportive. Consistent salary reviews.","Some campaigns have quite a lot of internal meetings, which can be annoying if you're the type to just get on with your work with minimal interference. The more skilled you become, the more attractive pay will be outside of Accenture. Lots of spam in the Accenture email, mostly about what's going on in other areas of Accenture. The nomination bonus system. It's crap. Very hard to accumulate points to actually get an item of value, and the points alledgedly get reset once a year.",5.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years"

In the 3-4 years I have been at Accenture, they have barely invested in any sort of training and I feel like, technically speaking, I have not progressed much - You are just a number. I found my experience at Accenture quite isolating. People tend to be focussed on their selves and their progression, you are essentially head to head with others. I found that when it comes down to it, people will not care about you and there is no sense of belonging or community - Way over the top with all this inclusion & diversity and things like that. They like to see you involved or you will find it difficult to achieve promotion - I have never gotten a bonus and quite unsure as to why - They seem to love to hire rapidly and then undertake lay-offs, so I really question the job security - Bench time is important even if they say it is not",3.0,"Former Employee, more than 3 years"

Once we were fully under Accenture all the process became very complicated and the clients left... ending my relationships with the company. I tried relocating but it was too hard as the agency I worked with in London was not a common capability for Accenture. So they could no longer justify my post.

Managing Directors. This includes slide formatting, coordinating time in the office, calendar management, timesheet and expense submissions, solving technology issues.

NA,8 Apr 2023,Being there was like dying,Full Time Internal Employee,"London, England",Having the name Accenture on my CV has been helpful. Those who have not worked there do believe the hype. Who am I to dissuade them?,"The only toxic place I have ever worked..They are the very definition of a soulless corporate. If you told me my experience there was an experiment of one human working with poorly programmed AIs I would believe you. Forget bringing yourself to work - bring a cyborg instead if you want to fit in. The woman on my right was on Prozac due to the stress of working there. The woman on my left couldn't sleep at night. Everyone was stressed because you couldn't trust anyone. We would complete work according to the description given by our manager and then that manager would pretended something different was said even though there were witnesses to the contrary. Reality became very skewed.. It is the only time in my life I've felt depressed, you feel like you are losing your mind. Lots of backstabbers who smile to people's faces and then complain behind your back.. One girl kept up a running commentary with my manager about anyone that she considered incompetent because she felt free to do so in that culture.

The client challenges are real, complex, and it requires the individual to develop a flexible mind to see problems from multiple dimensions, and identify opportunities to chart a way forward. This skill, developed continuously over time, will serve one well in the more advanced stages of their career. At the same time, there is a tremendous range of support and resources that are provided for the individual to make use of; the only challenge will be on the time that is available to make the full use of these - but for one who is determined, this will undoubtedly accelerate the pace of their advancement both technically and professionally.","Like most companies that cross the 10,000 employee mark, it becomes harder to ensure consistency. With a workforce of over 700K, and the UK workforce surpassing 10,000, one's career experience might vary depending on the project, peers, and reporting structure. Most of the negative reviews centre around a person's dissatisfaction with the promotion process, and the work involved to ensure the strongest possibility of getting promoted; this ranges from project feedback, representation in the appraisal process, and visibility. Balancing this many factors is a formidable challenge. Changes in a large organisation culture, or operating model take time - even if the benefits of change have been apparent for a while, convincing a sufficiently large critical mass of the leadership team is going to require one of two things: the decision is comes from a much higher authority, or the problem grows to an extent where its at the magnitude of a crisis, and cannot be ignored any longer.

Most of the time lost in the projects is a result of hasty decision-making and disorganised teams. Many of the Accenture employees in the team I joined worked about 12 hours per day and more depending on where they were working from. They don't take breaks for lunch or dinner most of the times, they long have forgotten that there is life after 6pm. It is like they wouldn't know what to do other than working if they were given free time. Very stressful projects.

NA,1 Mar 2022,Great and bad in doses,Digital Strategy Manager,"London, England","- You get to work with some incredibly smart people - Career progression is great - You learn a lot very quickly - Opportunities for training are good - I rarely met someone I didn't like personally - Pay is very good compared to 'in industry' for some industries - Overall business strategy is very clear - The share scheme is a 'must do'. Very beneficial - Some work is really great - Most of the leadership I met are genuinely fantastic people, who care about individuals","- Expectations around contribution are very often unrealistic (Day job + practice role(s) + side of desk + bid work + other things) - Ultimately you're a supplier and some clients take advantage of that (not all, just some) - Often coerced into roles that don't fit your career goals - Some projects can be ridiculous - Handling of pandemic was very poor. Took over a year for any home working financial support to come through. MDs were seen joking about working from home in large home offices while analysts were perched in shared communal spaces in their flats / family homes - Only interested in materially improving your working life / pay when you're leaving - Often a big disparity between what parts of Accenture say they do and what they actually do when it comes to project work. The 'PR' version is often groundbreaking tech, PoCs, design work etc, but the reality is that you will probably find yourself integrating an Oracle ERP at some client site in the middle of nowhere for 12 months with minimal internal recognition - Often it's the 'story' of what your work delivers over its actual value that is the focus, which I found incredibly frustrating. Often people would deliver a tiny piece of low impact work which involved some 'cool new' tech and they would be the poster child of their practice - compared to those who were delivering hard, complex, high value work. The latter (who account for most of the business's revenue) were often under-valued.",4.0,"Former Employee, more than 5 years"

Good working culture, if I need to be flexible to attend medical appointments for example I can. As long as work is delivered it doesn't really matter how it gets done, which I like. I'm given lots of freedom by my manager and team to approach my work in my own way, so there's a lot of trust there. There are also lots of opportunities to get involved in side of desk projects based on personal interest.","So much to do, so little time! Most of us are overworked/overwhelmed and many teams are understaffed. We don't get to spend time on personal development or learning because we're so busy. Also, where the company is so big, it's hard to know if you're really in contact with the right/best people when it comes to working on priority areas. You have to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations/suggestions which is obviously not standardised and means the quality of your work can depend on who you know. This is not good. Lastly I would say the idea of 'boundaryless opportunities' hasn't really been realised yet. Moving around within the company isn't an easy or clear process, especially if you're not client-facing. Also, Accenture are very forward thinking when it comes to I&D but this hasn't quite translated yet in Leadership - we're on track with our goals for women in leadership, but black people are still vastly underrepresented in leadership positions in the U.K. and across Europe.",4.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year"

If you turn down unsuitable roles you will be penalised. - analysts are taken advantage of by senior staff eg forced to work on clients without a chargeable code, which is then used against them at performance review - questionable management of the recent redundancy process - Accenture now having to rehire multiple roles, no senior management pay cuts etc - it looks bad to be throwing countless freebies at your employees whilst laying off 6% of the UK workforce - on paper, great policies regarding valuing the individual - yet to see this translate into the culture",1.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year"

NA,16 Sept 2021,Absolutely Shambolic,Senior Analyst,"London, England",Decent benefits such as private healthcare,"Absolutely disgusting company. There are about 10000 employees in the UK. A majority are from offshore India or Phillipines who have come over on a work visa. Therefore a majority of the technical work undertaken is done by these resources. If you are from the UK and want to do something technical, such as programming, you can be sure as hell it'll be sourced to these cheaper resources. This leaves you with mundane boring and repetitive business analysis/PMO work. Management can vary so you could be micro managed and work long hours. If you are on the bench, then they will bully you and pressure you into a role that you do not want. If you try to go for other roles, your department will find the people leads of those roles and collude behind your back to reject you, so they can steal you for their high priority role. This is because senior managers and directors have yearly KPIs to meet where they must make £X amount of sales or they get sacked. This becomes very political and can cause you a lot of distress. You also have a counsellor (mentor) who may also try to be political for his departments gains. The clients are boring big companies with old IT systems that are behemoths to maintain or change, and Accenture cannot handle them as it becomes messy and spaghetti like. All they care about is charging you to the client so you are billable and make them money. You don't actually learn anything transferrable to other companies and you can forget about any real technical skills. You'll get 10 people from your department chasing you to take a role, whilst they disregard your ambitions and future aspirations. I've never seen anything like it.

Corporate perks like gift cards, etc.","Likely underpaid for what you do, lots of weak management who are arrogant and don't realise they actually need support on management and to develop leadership skills, rapid promotion of people with low competence, culture that dislikes thought in favour of highly transactional work that can on occasion be completed to a low standard but passed off as gloss. Can be incredibly hierarchical - but not necessarily pinned to level, depends who likes you. People no matter how good their background and output is are essentially told to 'shut up and make it look pretty', that they 'don't know anything' by very mediocre people rehashing non-sensical ideas in front of clients, or just repeating things they've heard and using consulting jargon to mask things. It's very much a taker culture, full of backstabbing, especially around promotion time. They don't care about people, you are just your employee number. They pay lipservice to all the right things but good luck finding action to actually back it up around things like diversity, work-life balance and mental health. It's mainly marketing, show pony-ism and people stealing other people's ideas while telling them their worth nothing. Disgraceful culture - filled with people who don't even bother to report harassment because they don't feel they'd get much help, particularly if the perpertrators are perceived to be company favourites. Senior people who won't report incidents of people using offensive language around protected characteristics, or intimidating employees who've called these things out (admittedly this seems like a bigger problem in the larger parts of the business), but will go on linkedin and post about their commitment to diversity and promote the completion of conduct surveys, citing that bad behaviour should be called out.

Finding good roles is also based on knowing the 'correct' people. This is stressful and can easily impact the actual work you need to do to excel.

But only if you know how to play the game - Work/life balance is not too bad when staffed on a large project. Smaller short term projects are a different story - Excellent place to build a network in the industry","- Compensation has been the hot topic for years now. Accenture does pay less than its competitors and the move to a plc effectively took away the carrot for becoming an SE, which results in typically less pay with the promise of more in a far away future - Promotions and laddering processes are incredibly subjective. It is about who you know and not what you do. Accenture will always claim it is fair yet most people know it is not. Having seen the process from both sides it is quite disfunctional - With sales targets becoming more and more important, emphasis is on selling and not delivery. This results in over promising clients what really can be achieved, to the point of inventing offerings Accenture does not have. When the delivery team comes in (and the sales have been booked and the sales team long gone) they are often faced with delivering something that was promised but cannot realistically be achieved. It sometimes borders on what is legal. - Little respect for employees in lower ranks. No respect for clients at all which is worrying. Often joking about their 'stupidity' and the fact they are 'gold mines' is not very professional nor respectful.",2.0,Current Employee

It sounds clichéd, but in the consulting world people are the only important asset, and the people at Accenture are generally fantastic. The amount you can learn when working at this pace is amazing, and it is a great place for accelerated professional development. The remuneration is pretty good - I used to say 'it's good, but it's not banking', but it seems like a more stable place to be since the global financial crisis led to the end of ridiculous city bonuses. A diverse range of interesting clients and interesting projects is another huge plus point.","As with any consulting firm, there are high expectations which go with the level of responsibility you are granted. The focus on delivery means that there are times when excessively long hours are required - however in my view the culture of constant long hours is dying. There is an expectation that managers will plan projects on the basis that people work normal hours, and despite peaks and troughs in activity, if the hours are consistently long then it reflects badly on the manager. There is also a lot of travel, sometimes to great places and sometimes to the middle of nowhere.",4.0,Current Employee

Who in their right mind doesnt check basics up front, like salary, location, eligibility to work in location - they will waste an entire recruitment process as they ask these questions at the LAST step.

Big egos that enjoy using heir position of authority to intimidate others. This might be obvious by now, but there is no interest in employee wellbeing. Nobody cares about you and some managers don’t even acknowledge you existence when you walk into the office unless they need you to do something. The result is low morale, fear, and a very high turnover. Don’t be fooled by the glossy offices and the high tech look of the place.

Exposure – Accenture’s model relies of consultants delivering value for money for the client while also being profitable for the business, so it’s not uncommon to find yourself in a challenging role with good exposure to key projects and programmes in the industry 3. Networking – the UK business is boasts several thousand employs so it’s a fantastic opportunity to meet new people with different skills and from a diverse set of backgrounds great for building up your own network 4. Work-life balance – few consulting firms will offer 30 days paid holiday along with 3 corporate volunteering days, on top of that there are several opportunities within the year to meet and have a drink on the project, the department or internal networks 5. Training – fantastic training opportunities especially for graduates but also across the board 6. Perks – subsidised gym membership, corporate discounts, health check days","1. Variance of projects - your personal well-being is very much contingent on your project and the work you do, so there is definitely a risk that is you are not placed on the right project for you then could be doing either a role you do not like or at a client / environment you do not like and this could be for a medium to long period of time. As it’s often difficult to move yourself off chargeable client work consultants may find themselves getting pigeon holed in a particular role just to meet demand. 2. Attrition – the positive about exposure can work in reverse if the promotions and consequential salary hike do not keep up with the accelerated responsibility and scope of contribution; consultants can often feel demoralised doing a role “above their pay grade” causing them to consider their options and leave the firm. 3. Politics – like any consulting firm internal politics can influence promotion decisions as it’s often who you know rather than what you know, but this is expected for an organisation of the scale of Accenture. 4.

Having Accenture on your CV opens a lot of doors for you, just be careful which doors you go through as potential employers will do and say anything to have someone with Accenture experience on their CV.","For every one good person you meet there are nine not so good people. Depending on what stage of the project you are at, you more often than not will work long hours - especially during project delivery or when you have a rubbish manager who has missed numerous targets and the client is angry. You need to remember, especially as an analyst, that clients are paying upwards of £500 per day for you to be there. So you need to know your stuff, and if you don't, find someone in Accenture's vast network who can educate you, most people will be helpful. Most clients will try and push you to your limit and ask you to go above and beyond. You need to be mindful of your own well being and learn to diplomatically manage expectations. Some members of the client organisation will be keeping a close eye on you, watch out when you take coffee breaks, and if you need to smoke then do it well away from the front door of the client's office. It should go without saying, but stay off Facebook, Twitter etc in the client office. If you feel the need to social network during the day, do it slyly on your phone, in the toilet or at lunch break. Salaries for an Analyst range between £31-32,000, and for a Consultant £43,000+. Since leaving Accenture I have realised that this is incredibly low for the amount of work you do, and for the qualifications you no doubt have. However, you are in a privileged position if you get a job there to learn a great deal about business, sharpen your relationship management skills and generally be a bit of a boss :). Some people get put straight into a software / IT testing role, and hate it. It does seem a little strange at first, and if you have a non technical degree it might be difficult to get a grasp of. Testing is the least glamorous. However, I feel that spending a few months doing it is a blessing in disguise as most consulting engagements you will work on throughout your career will have an IT element, knowing about the testing process and it's importance will stand you in good stead, You will need to move on from it though as it get's a little boring, so you need to build a network to utilise to get on other projects. There's no harm in finding a partner of a particular practice and dropping them an email, or even cold calling them. Even the friends you'll make from your start group will be able to help. The only major problem I have with Accenture is their performance management process, a forced distribution model. Someone has to get the top rating, and someone has to get the bottom rating (it's a little more complex than that). This can create a rather cut-throat atmosphere and I have experienced other people of my level being deliberately unhelpful as a result of this. That said, I worked on some projects where people didn't behave like that so it's luck of the draw. Overall it's a fantastic experience. I wouldn't want to work for them again, but that's just me. If you have an offer from them, take it.

There is loads of training available. If you are lucky, some can be abroad. But it can sometimes be tricky getting permission to attend. Client work takes priority over training. In general, a nice, inclusive culture. Plenty of socials, if that is your thing. You get to effectively work for a bunch of different companies/clients and see what it is like to work for those companies.","One reason I joined was for the opportunity to travel, ideally abroad. In reality, this is quite hard to do and only happens if there are no roles in the U.K. that your skills could be used in, i.e. you don't get to go abroad because you would like to, only if there is a business need to do so. Commutes can be long - you are expected to commute up to 2 hours each way. Anything more and a hotel may be used. 2 hours may seem fine, but it really does wear you down over the months. And you end up with not much of a life during the week. Software engineers are not first class citizens at Accenture - consultants are. So, rather unfairly, software engineers get a lower salary and less holiday than a consultant at the same level - though software engineers do get limited overtime. If you apply as a grad and you have done computer science, you are funnelled into this lower paying area even though it may not be the area you applied for. The skill of the majority of the software engineers/developers in the company is not great and they generally focus on packaged applications rather than wiring actual code. Though, there are a few people who are very skilled and it is great to be able to learn from them - if you can find them. The entry interviews barely tested your skills, indeed, 1/3 of the software engineering grads I started with hadn't coded before... though they do train you up. Client work is the priority and late nights/weekends can become the norm on some projects. Below average salary for software engineers, especially in London. Your first role is key to deciding your future roles at Accenture. You become known for your primary skill and will be placed on roles using this skill in the future.

Annual performance reviews have no impact on your salary reviews; you can work hard all year round and receive a brilliant review to then be told there’s not enough in the EA pot to go round. The reviews should be carried out by the actual bosses you work for which is not the case. There are far too many EAs so you feel as though you are part of a factory run process; therefore promotions are very sparse. They have implemented some form of an EA promotion system which they change as they go along. The few promotions are mainly awarded to EAs already supporting more senior bosses.

But you really do work with the Best Project managers I have ever come across. - The Managing Directors (again for the most part) do seem to genuinely care for the people and do sort things out when an issue is bought to them. The Process for becoming an MD is far more stringent than the lower level promotions and definitely comes off more objective.","- It generally takes an experienced hire a year to learn the Accenture game, by which time they are usually on the back foot, have a bad rating and better off leaving 6 months later. After all - externally, you're Accenture stained by then anyway. For most people that adds value to their CV. - Lack of transparency around staffing. The best roles get filled by network - and if you're new, you have no network. And if you're unlucky, you join and get sent to the middle of no where by yourself for a year and then really are screwed. - Accenture career-lifers are ignorant to the outside world and new people entering into their cliques, which makes it difficult for the company to change or develop - Real lack of ideas. The company is full of Sales people and blow-hards, but not much content - Too much focus on doing internal Accenture work instead of actual client work. - People with the title Manager are a Rank and not actual Managers. It confers they are good at doing internal Accenture work more than they actually know how to Manage something.... especially people. - Low pay rises to no pay rises despite the company saying it is doing well year on year (Accenture is not seen as advisory vs the Big 4 so gets squeezed on day rates and on the other side is now competing with the big 6 of India for the IT work who bring low day rates too). Limited pay increases within Rank. - Focus on being a salesman first vs building actual expertise which Clients would pay more for - Lots of snakes in suits - too much of an ""I"" culture and no real collaboration. The performance process focuses too much on individuals and so there is a culture of not wanting to share ideas or work together as you can't claim credit. - The objectives / priorities system doesn't matter - all that matters is what is said about you in the laddering / talent discussions i.e. have some Snr Mgrs and MDs who like you and you'll go up easy enough, with or without talent - Boring work - If you have come from outside, the work is really vanilla. It might be big in scale, but really, its basic work. - lots of internal processes which no one cares about - great fill out your internal profile, CV, blog etc - but no one actually cares. - Moving around Accounts is career limiting, unlike other places where you're bringing new ideas and expertise to clients - Cost cutting on training in the past few years (no Chicago, less annual budget for real skills, no real quality training on industry topics)",2.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years"
NA,1 Feb 2017,Good opportunities if you're willing to fight for them,Analyst,"London, England","1) Flexibility. The firm is ultimately governed 'bottom-up' (by employee base) rather than 'top-down' (by leadership). Relationship building always trumps job description and formal policy. I've staffed myself on good projects, and whilst HR and management might not always endorse these moves (partly to prevent all-out chaos), their hard policies have limited coverage. This is a good mix of creating paths of least resistance that benefit the overall firm, whilst also keeping opportunities open for you if you're good and self-motivated. This is arguably a positive side-effect of some systemic problems within the firm. 2) Above market rate salary. 3) Excellent managers: people at the manager and senior manager level have been unilaterally great. Junior enough to care, but senior enough to materially help out. 4) Pockets of progressive policy, such as promotion discussions and performance evaluations (although implementation has something to be desired). 5) Diverse opportunities. Accenture is a huge professional services firm. They do everything from old IBM mainframe maintenance, to M&A due diligences, to marketing. What you're after is probably here. 6) Easy to move on. Even if things don't work out (e.g. an immovable policy blocks your progression within the firm) the experiences and skills learnt are easy to sell (after all, ACN does a bit of everything)!","The key driver of all the below problems is that consulting at Accenture (and perhaps the wider UK market) is highly commodified. 1) Lack of investment: particularly on benefits, training and office capacity (only 2 weeks of fairly austere onboarding, no phone provided, not enough desks in Fenchurch Street, tight controls on expenses, limited event budgets, few opportunities to work abroad). 2) Poor quality analysts: generally boring and lacking rigour (typical 2:i graduates from mid-table universities with a sports team and summer internship on their CV). 3) Poor quality projects: Accenture's bread-and-butter for new joiners are PMO and solutions roles on chunky systems integration projects that can last 1+ years. It's common in the firm to have spent your entire career working for a single client. This to me is not a consulting business, but a glorified job agency. You have to fight against the current to avoid these roles and go for the more 'interesting' work, which is definitely out there. 4) Demoralising and byzantine HR policy and controls. Most of this can be avoided (see pro above), but if you don't fight or get unlucky, company policy can railroad you. I personally joined on a management consulting offer, only for it to be converted in a tech consulting offer (upon day 2 on the job) - and HR lied to me on record about the change. This would be a bigger issue but it hasn't affected my career progression so far. Also: anxiety-inducing pressure from utilisation and changeability targets, poor scheduler relationships, and demands to engage in a narrow set of sanctioned extra-curriculars. 5) Bad reputation within consulting.",4.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year"

Guaranteed. - Making major efforts to increase BAME and female representation at all levels; these are starting to have a desired effect but this will have to be maintained on a permanent basis - Extremely good LGBTQ awareness; Stonewall has recognised them as one of the best employers in the UK for it. A large proportion of the LGBTQ employees are openly out (including UK board members).","- It's very hard to integrate from industry if you've never been a consultant before. I got 2.5 days training to understand the basics of how Accenture works. They tell you it takes 12 months to figure the company out. They are right, and that's only if you have support to help understand it. I didn't. - Management can be very hit and miss. In other departments I found them highly approachable (even the UK MD Olly was approachable and supportive when I needed his time despite having thousands of people working for him). My own management team were awful; my line manager (MD level) didn't communicate with me via any medium for the final 8 months of my time with Accenture. - Training is available but only if you're free to do it. Everyone is supposed to get a week of training; many did not due to client demands. - Work life balance can be poor. At one stage my client refused to allow me to take any vacation for 8 months and only acquiesced when an EMEA level senior MD intervened. Travel can be brutal; I took a 7 hour flight home from an overseas assignment just to be able to snatch a day and a half with family before having to fly back. - I was told I wasn't performing to expectations but wasn't given an explanation what was required nor any assistance (e.g. training or refresher) to address the gap. - Very cliquey. You're either in with management or you're on a slippery slope to the exit. It might take 12-18 months to get there, but you will. - Growing incredibly fast; too fast in my opinion. A breather from acquisitions would be a good idea to streamline and prevent overlaps and get rid of under performing management at SM and MD level. - When I left, strategy had lost its head and had nothing in the pipeline. This is going to be unhelpful for the other departments (consulting, digital, etc). - Frequently tried to shoehorn me into industries and job roles that I had no knowledge of.

Does not matter how good the lateral hire is, good opportunities are given to people who who have joined the grad programme and come up through the ranks, to the detriment of the lateral hire. Progression within the company is based on relationships & tenure rather than capability. The managing director level is a 50:50 mix of really capable people and people of no exceptional capability who have been promoted for no reason other than having joined the company in their grad programme and promoted based on tenure. Accenture has never really moved away from the laddering/ forced bell curve fitting approach to annual performance evaluations. Whilst it can be argued that this approach removes the weakest performers and hence improves performance of the company overall, the implementation is deeply flawed. People are put into the top and bottom performer segments based on relationships & tenure within the company instead of performance factors like client impact, delivery, quantum of sales or client relationships.",2.0,"Former Employee, more than 3 years"

Whether this is the case so much as it used to be in the Buonaguidi-independent days, is up for debate. One plus of the new Creative dept management team is that they have (albeit in a fairly Old School way) instilled some more discipline and rigour into the creative process at the agency. For new creatives going there who are liked by said management, there are opportunities to make, if not incredible, then solid creative work.","There’s a sort of fantasy perpetuated throughout the company that Karmarama is the ‘nicest’ ad agency in London to work for and that other agencies are riven by toxic office politics, and will work you to the bone. While there are undoubtedly other agencies that are and will do those things, Karmarama is by no means exempt from the same issues that blight many ad agencies. But this self perpetuated myth (with the numerous ‘Times best companies to work for’ awards often pointed to by management as being proof of) seems to keep many employees in the agency for longer than it is worth their while, and on way lower than average pay.

Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Being a large organization, Accenture can sometimes have layers of hierarchy and bureaucratic processes that can slow down decision-making and innovation. Variable Project Experience: The nature of consulting means that the quality and type of projects can vary widely. Not all projects may align with an employee's interests or career goals. Pressure to Perform: Due to the competitive nature of consulting, employees might feel pressure to constantly prove their value and meet high performance expectations.

Once you get experience however there is better pay and opportunities elsewhere. - Very sociable workplace with lots of company events.,"- Very difficult to control what projects you are assigned to or control your career unless you are a proficient networker and popular among others at the company. - You will often be pressured to take on projects you don't want, or are unqualified for in order to maintain chargeability. - Once you are promoted to consultant you will often find yourself relatively unsupported in roles or in one man teams. This is an issue when you have little experience in a particular role. - There is a toxic 'overtime culture' in the workplace.

It's important to note that Accenture is a service provider company and works with clients. Your role is very much dependent on the client. If you are assigned to a client, the client dictates your working hours and the flexibility of your shift or work location. If the client is difficult it can make your job a nightmare. The company places priority on pleasing the client as that's their source of revenue. If the project ends then you can no longer be billed to a client and you are a financial burden to the company.

This offers employees the opportunity to work on diverse and challenging projects and gain exposure to different industries and technologies. Professional development: Accenture emphasizes employee training and development. They offer various learning programs and resources to help employees enhance their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. Career progression: The company provides a structured career path and opportunities for growth. Employees are encouraged to take on new responsibilities and advance within the organization. Diversity and inclusion: Accenture promotes diversity and inclusion within its workforce, creating an inclusive environment that values different perspectives and backgrounds. Client-focused approach: Accenture's focus on delivering value to clients can be a rewarding experience for those who enjoy solving complex problems and making a tangible impact.","Work-life balance: Like many consulting and technology firms, the nature of the work may sometimes require long hours and tight deadlines, which can impact work-life balance. High-pressure environment: Accenture deals with significant and demanding projects, which can lead to stressful situations and tight schedules. Travel requirements: Depending on the role and project, employees may be required to travel extensively, which could be challenging for those who prefer a more stable work environment. Hierarchical structure: Some employees may find the hierarchical structure of the organization limiting in terms of decision-making and autonomy. Project-based work: Since Accenture often operates on a project basis, job security may be a concern for those seeking long-term stability. Ultimately, the experience of working at Accenture can vary depending on individual preferences, roles, and project assignments.

NA,14 Aug 2023,Would NOT recommend ANYONE work here - READ THE CONS!!,Senior Systems Engineer,"Cincinnati, OH",You learn a lot quickly and it looks good on your resume.,"I was with the company five years in the Cincinnati office. In that time I saw and witnessed some of the most unethical business practices and borderline malicious abuse that I have ever experienced in my entire career. 1. We were told to lie on our billable hours to the clients we supported. (Aka fraud). The clients of course didn't know this was happening. Management routinely made up hour ""billable hours"" and told us to charge hours to clients even if we didn't work them. Highly illegal. 2. The culture of toxicity and abuse was absolutely insane. You name it I've seen it. Managers holding their employees from career advancement out of pure ignorant and vindictive spite. Managers insulting employees in calls with 20+ people in attendance. I've seen people of power here back stab, call others people racists, insult other techs skill sets, threaten, lie, and manipulate. Ive seen managers throw temper tantrums and scream and yell at employees or insult them. Gaslighting here was an every day occurance. Promise promotions yet deny them end of year. Some people make 20-30k more than others when they do the same EXACT job as everyone else simply because management likes them more. Ive seen people who literally do NOTHING but wiggle their mouse around all day to not show as ""away"" get promotions and make 110k+ a year when they literally contribute nothing. Managers invoke fear tactics. Scare you into not billing for overtime. Make you feel guilty when you do bill overtime. They bred a hostile work environment that bled into all the tech teams. Very few employees are happy here. All time low morale. Internal teams constantly bad mouthing others, fighting, and arguing in team chat cussing out other employees and getting into scuffles. The entire place was a cess pool of poorly managed teams, bad leadership, toxic ethics. Zero standards. I saw five people quit in a time span of a year because of everything I just mentioned. This is not a disgruntled employee ranting. This is the FACTS and the TRUTH. This place is a nightmare. The best word I could use to summarize it all up is ""disgusting"". I felt literally disgusting working there. Everyday was a challenge. This place will rip out your soul and eat it and then ask for seconds. This place is consulting 101 but it's being ran by borderline crooks and horrible human beings with no ethics, morale compass, or humanity. You will be told to work 24.7 on call for a week. Then when you get paged off hours you're expected to work...but for free. If you bill overtime you will be questioned, scrutinized, and made to be fearful of actually billing it. This place is a employment lawyers dream. A lawsuit waiting to happen. I thought about hiring one myself but I wanted to just put the place behind me and move on. That doesn't however mean that I have to keep silent about what went on. This review represents that. Best thing I can do is warn people not to work here. If you are looking into the Cincinnati location then....Run. Run as FAST as you can.",1.0,"Former Employee, more than 5 years"

(the contractor time does not count toward this) So you have to commit some time before getting the actual benefits. There are nice perks such as staff parties etc. however there is normally only 3 free drinks and usually small-average food portion each at party. All the other bonuses which Accenture offers are only available to full time employed (converted emoloyees ) so they may not be immediately available if you start as a contractor. (This was not explained in great transparency during my onboarding) It is a lovely company to work for overall but while you are at a lower career level the salary is small and the benefits seem more a face value than benefits that are worthwhile.

This company may be considered as good for someone who is not getting any job anywhere else and for fresher’s (maybe).","I can mention as many cons as you want: 1. Salary and Package Stuff: Let's take an example you are working in an organisation as a Software Engineer, you are earning 6 Lac/Annum and having experience of 3 Years in IT. You cleared Accenture interview process (which is generally a cake walk). HR will extend an offer to you. HR will make every possible try to fool you. If you ask for Senior Software Engineer (SSE) Designation, HR will say as per company policy the minimum criterion for SSE is 3.5 Years so we cannot give you. If you ask for money, let’s say 25% hike, HR will say we cannot give that because it will be beyond their standards for a Software Engineer and they cannot go against the policy, but what we can do for you as an exception is that: we can give you the same package along with Joining Bonus which is 10% of Base (60,000) and 18% of variable pay. Variable pay will be payable 2 times (after 6 months). Variable pay also depends upon performance but Accenture is known for giving 100% variable pay to their employees without any deductions. After this most of the people become the prey of HR and join Accenture, but the truth is something different. Read point 2. 2. This is true that you will get joining bonus in the first month salary. But the variable pay will be give only 8% (not 18%) for 1 year. This is based on the default rating as per Accenture. No matter how good you perform, you are not going to get your 100% variable pay. Example: Let's say you are eligible for 1 Lac Rs in 1 Year as your variable pay. You should be getting this in two parts 50,000 each (assuming you are a good performer and company is also performing well). You will be shocked to see not more than 24,000 Rs after 6 Months (you were expecting 50,000 Rs). This is company policy. HR will not tell you this at the time of joining. You will feel like cheated and surely disappointed. 3. You can find a SSE earning less than a SE and also some SSE earning more than a TL level person. Nothing at all standardised. 4. Promotions: Promotions solely depends upon your relation with your manager. Any similarity whatsoever with your good performance is purely coincidental. I have seen extremely good people having experience of 5.5 Years at SE level also. Such people are just prey of internal politics. I really feel sad for those chaps. 5. If you were on bench for some time, say 2 months, forget about variable pay. Continuing the above example you are not going to get more than 14,000 (in any case). 6. BEWARE: If you are joining Accenture Gurgaon just only for the Gurgaon location, then this is highly likely that you can soon be relocated mercilessly if you remain on bench for some time. They have all rights to force you. On the day of reporting (1st day in Accenture), they will make you sign a document that states this clause. 7. Notice Period: As you might be aware that the notice period has been increased to 90 Days. The same has been done for Infosys also. The good news is, if you are under probation period, you can get out of this mess in just 30 days. :) 8. Medical Policy for Parents: Only Employee, his wife and children are ensured. If you are a bachelor and your parents are dependent on you, then sorry, Accenture is not responsible for them. You have to purchase a medical policy for your parents. 9. Accenture doesn't believe in equality. Anybody less than Team Lead level is actually less than a human being. Let me give you one example: If you are at Team Lead level or above only then you will get Car Parking stickers. Below that level, please use company transport. You are not supposed to come by car. And if you prefer to come by bike, please note Accenture has very limited parking. If tokens are not available then wait outside under the sun till the time someone goes out. Note: 1. I am talking about Accenture Gurgaon office, DDC2 (Near Signature Tower). 2. Accenture does not have first in first park policy as it may hurt some project managers and senior management people while waiting outside. 3. They do have sufficient space to accommodate at least thrice the available car parking (125 slots). But, Accenture is not willing to pay for the additional parking cost for their below TL level servants... oh sorry, employees. Mind you, Accenture is a 21 Billion + $ revenue generating company. 10. Onsite Opportunities: Depends project to project, but due to huge internal politics, opportunities are limited to the near and dear employees of the project manager. 11. Non-Professional behaviour by the Project Managers and TL level people. North India is generally known for being very non professional and after joining Accenture Gurgaon, I get to know the reason behind such perception. Example: Project Manager and TL level believes in oral work related communications (in hindi language, no english please kind of work environment) rather than written. But if you do any mistakes, they will not leave any chance to escalate the matter in written. They does not hesitate using Red colour while composing such mails. This is surely against business ethics. 12. No work from home facility. This facility in only reserved for Project Manager. So, please don't ask for laptops and VPN access. Sorry. 13. Spam Mails: Expect getting approx 25 spam mails from Accenture itself that does not have anything to do with you. 14. Stationary: This Company is so poor that it will not issue you a single pencil without an online ticket that you have to raise. They call themselves as an environment friendly company that is saving papers that employees used to fill to issue stationary material. I prefer using my own stationary rather than raising new tickets. This is exactly what they want. 15. This is very small thing but you are going to miss paper towels in washrooms. Again, the answer comes: we are environment friendly company so we do not provide paper towels in washrooms. Whenever they want to save money, they say they are environment friendly. You decide. 16. Security: They don't leave any chance to harass their employees. Security Check-1: The drama starts in the morning when you reach the barrier (just before the building, near the NH-8 highway). Some illiterate, ill-mannered security guards will welcome you and pretend to check your car by looking inside the car and will smash the boot door of your loving car. Goshh!!! what a bad feeling it is... You will fell like killing him, but you cannot do anything, sad. Security Check-2: Once you cross the barrier, the same brutal treatment is waiting for your car again. Yes, another security check. Your car boot will be opened and smashed again without being looked at inside. They say they are checking for explosives. God knows how they determine without looking inside. Security Check-3: Let’s move on, park your car. On the parking exit towards the lift, you will meet one more security guard who will ask you to show your carry bag/laptop bag etc. This guy is amazing; he will unzip and zip the bag without even looking into that. Security Check-4: Once you reach your floor you will meet one more security guard that will again pretend to check your bags. I would have been more than happy if they were actually doing a security check. The fact is they are just pretending do it, wasting your time and damaging your car. Believe me, nothing more than that. 17. Cafeteria: Everything is paid. Vendors are pathetic. You will feel regretted after spending your hard earned money on the pathetic food. You will get lunch @ 45 Rs (full plate). It will be fixed quantity, no buffet system at all. Please do not dare asking for more, you will get a blunt/rude reply only. If you are coming from a product based company, you are going to miss those luxuries and good behaviour of office boys. 18. Medical Facility: In papers, every day a doctor is available from 3PM to 5 PM on weekdays. But, at the most he/she comes 2 times in a week only. 19. No AC facility in cabs. Employees have to pay directly to the cab drivers if they wish AC to be turned on. I feel pity for my fellow colleagues who come from Noida and surrounding areas in non-AC cabs in Summers of Northern India where the temperature touches 45 Degrees Celsius. 20. Dress Code: As in many service based companies, here also you have to follow the dress code. You need to wear formals (except Friday). On Fridays, you cannot wear round neck T-Shirts. Your supervisor has all rights to fine you Rs 500 if found guilty for violating this ""LAW"" for the first time, if you are unlucky enough to be caught second time then you will be sent home and it will be considered as PTO (Paid Time Off). Awesome! Also, you are not supposed to wear Shirt/T-shirt bearing any corporate logo other than Accenture logo. That means, even if you are coming from Microsoft, you cannot wear a T-Shirt/Shirt having Microsoft logo or its name. 21. Oops... I forgot to tell you about HR. Accenture HR people are the most useless people in the world. There is ZERO co-ordination between them. When your interview process is going on, believe me, nobody knows where the process actually is. They will literally call you and ask you, what all rounds have been done with you. Anybody will wake up and call you from their department. In my case, after getting the offer letter, one HR called me to schedule the technical interview. Can you believe this? They don't know if the candidate has already gone through the selection process or not. I spoke to 12 different HR people during my selection process. I am sure ""each"" Accenture employee will agree on this without exception. 22. Long working hours (8:30 AM to 6:30 PM). People using company transport has to follow these timings, others come late generally. I hope these points are enough to open your eyes. Would that, I were knowing these things before joining Accenture, Gurgaon!!!",1.0,Current Employee

It is very easy to get burn out in this company because of that. It got to a point, that even agents that I don't manage would reach out for me for help, because their own leads wouldnt be present.

A lot of the overtimes were unpaid The management also likes to schedule meetings outside of working hours (unpaid) The means of evaluation is via Bell Curve. Employees are not rated according to how they perform their tasks but how they perform as compared to their other peers. So everyone is always in a pressure to do better than everybody else in order to be promoted, until it reaches the point of unhealthy expectations and goals.

Good Employee Benefits: Accenture often offers competitive salaries, healthcare benefits, and sometimes, opportunities for travel. Global Network: Given Accenture's international presence, employees have the chance to network with professionals across the globe, providing exposure to a range of perspectives and practices.","Long Working Hours: Some employees report the expectation of long working hours, which might affect work-life balance. High-Stress Environment: Due to the demanding nature of consultancy and the scale of projects, the work environment can be high-pressured and stressful.

I was in for the rudest shock I have experienced in my 15 year career. The other ‘senior managers’ were rude, unwelcoming, abrupt, closeted and down right hostile. The partners to whom they had sworn their loyalty to, sheparded them, coddled, and ‘protected’ them, gave them the choicest billable roles, while I was the black unwanted sheep. It took a few months to realize, the toxic, inbred, incestuous culture was one of ‘BROWN NOSING YOUR WAY UP’ ! The way to cling to and climb the ladder was purely based on this one vital ability ! A lateral hire, though more qualified and creative, was a threat, to the insecure incestuous bunch. I was later told during my exit interview, ‘yes, it’s difficult to assimilate as a senior lateral hire !” !!! HA ! So, if you want to go jump into a toxic hole, then be my guest. To me, it was one of the worst experiences in my life ! Ever wonder where these genes came from ? Look just back to the deceptive ‘Anderson Consulting’ days….the Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

While the organization claims to have a flat organizational structure, it seems that decision-making power lies primarily with the PMs and the stakeholders, leaving limited influence or any say-so for the developers. Career advancement opportunities are challenging to come by, as individuals are often placed in specific roles and discouraged from exploring different paths.

This lack of autonomy can result in being assigned to projects that may not align with your interests or expertise. 4. Competitive work culture: Accenture maintains a competitive work environment, where employees are constantly evaluated and ranked against their peers. This pressure to perform at a high level consistently can add stress and create a sense of competition among colleagues. 5.
