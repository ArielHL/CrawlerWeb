NA,3 Sept 2023,"Toxic work culture, high churn",Senior Associate,"London, England",Exposure to interesting work and important clients,"Toxic feedback culture - people often use this as a way to show how competent they are compared to those below them under the guise of “driving quality”, lack of appreciation for good work (eg never good enough even if your work exceeds clients’ expectations), rampant gaslighting - eg convincing you that you are to blame for not not working efficiently enough if you are working late dealing with an unmanageable workload to keep the pretense of work life balance. You are as big as your smallest error - even if the ones accusing you have made similar errors. This incentivizes people to be the first to give negative feedback at the first sign of trouble on a project. People are generally self interested and will not put themselves in any personal risk to do what is right or fair (with precious few exceptions) and, in any case, can turn their back on you at a moment’s notice depending on how the winds blow.",1.0,Current Employee

NA,29 Aug 2023,Disappointing experience at Operate,Scrum Master,"London, England",Flexiable Good training Generally friend colleagues (At SA level anyway) Great offices and subsidised food was very nice,"I was really excited to work at PwC as a Scrum Master but it was a huge disappointment. Part of it probably applies to all the big 4 and any global consultancy in the fact that I had no connection to a manager who knew what I was doing. I had a career coach and a line manager (Who both kept changing) but neither really knew what I did and were not working on me so the onus is on you to collect feedback and justify yourself. Simply doing a really good job is not going to get noticed. In my whole year and a bit working for Operate at PwC I think I actually worked with someone face to face once, the rest was all work from home. This felt very disconnected and I really did not get to know anyone. (This was becasue colleagues were based away from London in Belfast, Glasgow etc) I was hired as a Scrum master but for the first year I was doing project management work and not SM work which was highly frustrating. I had to leave the project I was on to go on the bench so I might actually get a chance of doing some Scrum master work. I did eventually get some but by then it was too late and the SM on the project did not understand Scrum anyway. I joined as an experienced hire at SA level which in hindsight was a mistake. At SA level the pay is poor as is the benefits and pension. It's only at manager level where things look better. The trouble is to get promoted is a complete pain which you need to put in lots of extra work in and only then will you get an opportunity if there is an opening, again as I said before just being really good at your job is not enough. Lots of senior managers are really quite old school, there’s a pretence of caring and helping but ultimately they just want the people below them to do the work and are quite happy to pile on the pressure. To cap it all off when I resigned I wanted to shorten my 3 month notice period but they would not hear it. Even though my project was coming to an end and the last month and a half were on the bench they still would not let me go early, bizarre! So overall not a great experience, it's obviously a huge company and elsewhere on the firm could have been different but mine was very poor in Operate.",2.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year"

This charge for quitting is literally thousands of pounds. For most recent graduates, the fees threatened mean you essentially cannot quit for 3 years (since the fees are more than most can afford to pay). - There is excessive overtime nearly every day (and many weekends) from January through to May. - There is frequent overtime at all other times of year (with some luck depending on what job you are randomly allocated to). - If you calculate your hourly pay it is much worse than the salary would imply, because of the overtime. Often during 'busy season' the hourly pay for graduates is comparable to minimum wage jobs because of overtime. - There is flexible working in name only if you are joining as a graduate. You will be promised 2-3 days a week at home, but in reality will be pressured to go into the office far more frequently, especially during busy season. You will be pressured constantly into publically sharing when you are going to the office, even if you don't want to. - PwC claims to aim for quality, but in reality they have been chasing record profits by cranking out low-quality audits. This is done by understaffing, since it is more profitable to have salaried employees doing excess overtime than bring in an adequate number of staff. This is a good deal for partners, but a bad deal for most other employees (especially graduates). - There is a culture of passing the blame downwards. Senior associates and associates are blamed for failings when the root problem comes from understaffed jobs. - A high number of staff are currently leaving to find better employers, meaning that PwC will not be a pleasant place to work for the foreseeable future while they rush to plug the gap. - During your training contract if you fail any professional exam by more than 10% below the pass mark you are likely to be fired immediately. This happens to many people every year. Exams therefore become extraordinarily stressful and unpleasant.",1.0,Current Employee

Also provide great wider benefits (not bonuses, insurance, employee perks, mortgage advice etc)","Really bad butt kissing culture with very limited (dare I say, 0) opportunities to progress in marketing (the business is different), and a leadership which hasn't changed for decades making it impossible for innovation to take place. It's a clique group and the effort required to even be CONSIDERED for promotion means you need to sell your soul and dignity in order to be positioned. There's also a lot of gripes around equal opportunities for roles; often jobs are handed out without ever being posted which is incredibly unfair and biased. The firm talks a lot of talk about mental health awareness and the importance of 'speaking up' however, in my personal experience whenever I've done so, I've been shut down and told that 'nothing could be done'. In one example, a Partner made comments about slitting your wrists at work in front of a jr team member who was self harming, I went to HR and the response via the Partner was 'my door is always open if you want to talk.' ... No thank you. There is also blatant favouritism, and those who are in the circles always get put on the big projects which provide the biggest opportunities for visibility. No one is ever surprised to see who gets promoted as the trail of crumbs is 2 years old. From a training perspective, there is limited opportunities (for marketing). People are put into roles that they have no training in (i.e. digital marketing) and aren't ever expected to get training other than 'on the job'. That's fine, so long as other people around you know what they're doing .. which they don't, Whenever the team has raised concerns with the 30+ people who have resigned following the pandemic, the response from the top is always 'we're not seeing any more leavers than we would in a normal year' which I find extremely difficult to believe. We are currently so under resourced I'm not even sure who will be left come Christmas. People are exhausted. Marketing has had no break since this all began and all we've been rewarded with is a bar of chocolate sent in the post at Christmas 2020 ........ I'm not surprised at the amount of people who are leaving and I very much think this trend will continue until drastic change takes place.",2.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years"

NA,4 Jun 2021,Abandon All Hope,Associate,"Glasgow, Scotland","The salary is okay, and there are some amazing people","I have worked in some truly terrible jobs in my time. In fact, prior to joining PwC, I didn’t think it could get much worse than my last job. But, as PwC constantly reminds us, they do like to “Reimagine the Possible”. And they’ve certainly done that. Starting a new job during a pandemic was never going to be easy, and in part, I’m sure some of the issues I have experienced may be attributable to that. But, pandemic or not, the standard of training and support that I, and others, have received, has been nothing short of disgraceful. Thrown into client work for the first time during the company’s busy season, we were often left to fend for ourselves, expected to complete complex documents with little or no guidance and to unbelievably short deadlines. And if, on some rare occasion, someone did think to reach out to offer help, it was often at their own expense, adding yet more stress to their already impossible workload. Here, credit must be given to the few truly wonderful people at PwC who do care about the welfare of others, knowing - often from personal experience - just how little support is given. It was this, more than anything, that first made me realise that PwC’s problems are not born of the pandemic; they are endemic, and likely have been for some time. The PwC grad scheme also offers you the chance to sit accountancy exams. And while, on the face of it, this might seem like a great opportunity to have your employer pay for you to obtain a much sought-after certification, the exam seasons I have endured so far have verged on the edge of torture. PwC offers the bare minimum in terms of study leave. In fact, despite the fact that the exams are a requirement of the job, they actually give them very little consideration. Pre-course work must be done on your own time. During busy season, this means working late into the night during the week (after an 11- or 12-hour day) and often at the weekend. On top of that, many of my peers, myself included, have even been forced to use all our limited holidays to have even a hope of passing. During the 4 or 5 weeks of classes, you have no option but to revise every waking hour of the day. And the sad reality is that, even then, your chances of passing are slim. The resources ICAS provide are poor in quality, riddled with errors, and the exercises often don’t match the content of the notes. The standard of teaching is mixed, with some clearly experienced tutors, and some who visibly struggle to comprehend the content they profess to teach. And while I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, their inexperience may be about to cost several people their jobs. Now you might be wondering if upper management are aware of what’s going on. Has anyone thought to speak out, let someone know what’s happening? Yes. Time and again, we have called meetings with seniors and representatives who claim to have our best interests at heart, who claim to care about our mental health and well-being. I have sat in meetings where my strung-out, exhausted colleagues have recounted their experiences through tears. In many cases, they haven’t slept well in weeks, can barely find time to eat, and are generally struggling to cope. Time and again we have told ourselves “Surely, something has to be done now!”. But no. Each time, we are met with reassurances that our concerns will be raised with senior management. And, in fairness, maybe they are. But ultimately, it always comes to nothing. In all my life, I don’t think I’ve ever worked with a more burnt out, run down, and generally miserable group of colleagues. And if there was ever a more damning piece of evidence that PwC is failing its employees, it’s that those that have been fired for failing exams (and I have known more than a few) were not devastated or disappointed, nor even remotely perturbed. They were grateful. You might think that I’m writing this in the hope that PwC will see it and care enough to do something. But in the year that I’ve been here, PwC have demonstrated, time and time again, that they do not care. No. I am writing this in the hope that somewhere out there, someone who has just received a very tempting offer letter from PwC might read this, and think twice before accepting.",1.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year"

People on the career ladder only seem to care about money. Every action is targeted towards having highlights to say at end of year review in order to justify a big bonus or promotion. Promotion is primarily based on time served and making friends with those above you. Short term gain is put above long term gain. A quick decision is better than the right decision. I saw and heard some very dubious actions, at best they were unethical, some possibly illegal. They also don’t like junior staff challenging senior staff, it’s viewed as being “difficult” and “not collaborative”. Very hierarchical, people like to appear senior so will try to keep hierarchical structures so they can say they had people report to them. A lot of managers couldn’t manage and didn’t have a clue what they were doing. The resulting chaos usually results in junior staff working on stuff that isn’t necessary and doing lots of overtime. There is surprisingly little processes and procedures. How something gets done or what decisions gets made is largely up to whoever is on the job. Pay is very asymmetrical, partners are on ridiculous salaries while those at the bottom can be quite low. Feel that senior people justify this as “time severed” and now they can get the rewards.",1.0,"Former Employee, more than 1 year"

Good salary if you are in the early stages of your career (2-4 years of proposal experience).","Also, the structure of the proposal team leaves a lot to be desired. You report into Sales and Marketing, however, you are assigned a line of service to work for. There is a lot of noise created in amongst the Sales and Marketing org, where internal projects which offer little to no value to the business require almost 50% of your working time (this is expected). Career progression internally is not clear, with many people leaving the organisation to further themselves. If people do stay, they tend to move into account manager roles, however, these roles at PWC involved liasing with a customers procurement team, and setting up meetings between partners and the c-suite (who you never get access to). A real issue of diversity within the organisation too. The proposal team has no BAME representation in any management positions. Also, have been told that one particular line of service is best avoided with bullying rife in it, so do ask about working conditions/ relationships with the key line of service stakeholders if you interview.",3.0,Former Employee

As such, every time you try and get on to a role it is like you are applying for a new job again. 3. The promotion process at the end of scheme is very opaque and getting in to a team you want to join is much more about who you know then how capable you are 4. The pay is the worst of the Big 4 and doesn't really rise in the first two years, even after the two years it barely rises (31K starting - 33K - 38K after scheme in London). There's no genuine bonus scheme - it is largely flat across all Associates (no motivation to stand out). Graduate pay hasn't risen in six years. 5. PwC talk a lot about culture and care in mental health but they don't carry this out in practise - I've seen associates get ignored and threatened when they have brought up issues surrounding their mental health. 6.

I’ve heard people being praised for working to 10pm (although no-one actually checks if they’re really working). It’s nuts, Training is appalling. Genuinely the worst I’ve ever seen. Non existent, expect to be thrown on to complex testing engagements with the same expectations on you from day 1 as the person sat next to you who’s been there 5 years (and when is too stressed with their own workload to be any use to you). It’s also nearly impossible to book holidays between beginning of October to end of February in what they call “busy season”. Expect to be vitamin D deprived - you will truly barely see outdoors apart from waking to/from office in morning/evening. Public humiliation is 5he order of the day - daily trackers of work completed plus managers do something called taskbook reviews where they weekly sit with you at your desk in front of colleagues and grill you in some detail/humiliate you if they disagree with your approach.

NA,13 Sept 2019,A means to an end,Manager,"Belfast, Northern Ireland","The pros of working in PwC (Operate) are atypical of any large firm in Belfast. They can give a graduate a much needed CV uplift in terms of experience. You can travel, they are flexible with working from home (certain projects are more lenient) They are also relocating Operate to the city Centre so it will be easy to access","The company is infested with shrewd yes men who care nothing apart from you their own career advancement and will sink you in a millisecond. On this note, it goes without saying be careful who you call your friends. PwC’s wider firm exploits Belfast as a cheap resource, this is particularly true for the London and Manchester teams who view Belfast as a service delivery centre. In addition as you work across teams throughout the UK you will struggle to identify who your team is. Without naming specific teams, the turnover rate is unheard of. At one stage a team had 10 notices in at one time and 25% of employees wanted to stay, Having worked at citi and KPMG I can say that If you want to pursue a career in this sector you are in the wrong place. The pay is the worst part and undoubtedly the reason for the turn over, imagine working 3-5 years at university to be paid 17k, it will take you 5 years and 5 promotions to earn a ‘decent salary’ so work this out, you graduate at age 22 get a job at PwC age 23, and work for 5 years, by the time you are 28 you will be on the same wage as a graduate in citi or Deloitte and even still it is not guaranteed you will be promoted every time. There are some people in the firm who are content and have the fear to move elsewhere,This is the reason why the turnover is what it is. From a managerial perspective they do not acknowledge this. If you’re easy to manipulate and wish to become a “team lead” with little to know technical knowledge you could bluff your way into a senior position, providing that you are climbing the greasy pole. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the role is that your hard work is not recognised, you could work 40 hours overtime and obtain ZERO recognition, however if you organise an out of office social event you could be in for a promotion, this is unheard off in this sector. The title suggests a means to an end, that is exactly what this job is. Get your 1-4 years done and move on and enjoy working in a role where you are treated like an adult. I’ve gave place this a 2 star rating, this is very generous and undoubtedly only given because of the happy aspects and friends I have met in this company",2.0,"Former Employee, more than 3 years"

To begin to even approach earning a ‘modest’ salary you will need to be there at least 4/5 years, with the caveat being you will need to navigate your way through the political atmosphere and speak to the ‘right’ people. • The prestige of the ‘PwC’ brand has been badly tainted by operate, as in my experience speaking to other employers it is seen very much so as cheap labour, without the expertise of the wider PwC pillars. • In some cases overtime is mandated, which could be in excess of 10 hours more than your usual full time hours.

They don’t have the attitude and the skills to work like proper lawyers. The promotion and rewards process is very unfair, as it is the allocation of work (which is why we now have a ‘fair access to work’ policy - not really working tho). As a lawyer, you have no supervision or mentoring; nor particularly outstanding legal people able to inspire you. There is a strong hierarchy only based on how long you’ve been in the firm or how long you’ve known the partner (in the latter case, you could have been charging 45 hours in 7 months and still get promoted to senior manager). The bonuses and salaries are way far from being in line with the market rate (for example, mine has been less than 2K this year which is way less than what I’ve been told I would have earned when u joined, 10/15%). In addition, there is a huge pay gap between legally and non-legally qualified people in teams which is then not taken into account in the rates payed by clients - which is highly unfair both for the clients and the non-legally qualifies colleagues themselves. Lastly, the management (both the team partner and the BU partner) have proven not to be able to adjust their strategy to the market: after a year of struggles, they still haven’t done anything to make this right and generate (finally) revenues - unless overexposing themselves (and oversharing) on LinkedIn.",1.0,"Current Employee, more than 1 year"

If you aren't given these opportunities, or the opportunities in your team never come to fruition, or your projects are cancelled by leadership, you don't stand a chance of receiving a high rating. Essentially the performance system if flawed with inequity and is out of the employees control. Therefore creating a culture of competition, not coaching and care. If you are in the internal firm services, you will struggle to get promoted as the competition for roles is getting higher, senior managers don't leave or want to advance to director, and are therefore creating a ceiling for managers to continuously bump their heads on.

Lots of smart people crammed together in one place means people have gained lots of experience and if you get along well with them, you’ll probably learn a lot too. 4. Internal people networks are supportive. There’s a fair few special interest / people groups and if you associate with them you can make some great connections / friends beyond your own team. 5.

You won’t be doing the latest of nights in Tax compare to other industries / divisions, but you will consistently be working beyond your contracted working hours, around an extra hour or two of overtime every day with the odd late (23:00 +) night (and it’s very difficult to get any overtime pay).","INFRASTRUCTURE: 1. Opaque progression pathways. People with the same grade / background are treated completely differently for progression and promotion and this is reflected in the lack of knowledge new promotes have of actually how they were promoted! Have been told that formal requirements for promotion need to be supported by cosying up to senior management as well (in some, but not all teams) - basically it’s still an old boys’ club, at least for now. 2. Awful internal technology. Internal software is either internally developed and outdated / not fit for purpose or is purchased externally, but then poorly implemented (e.g. internal technology champions are poorly supported / trained). Almost all employees complain about internal technology constantly but these grievances are rarely acted upon and when they are, management make ill-informed procurement decisions (e.g. choosing technology for the ""wow factor"" rather than functionality / usability for employees), where the technology is then forced upon users with little support. Extremely disappointing for a Big Four firm. 3. Poorly remunerated for equivalent grades at other Big Four firms. It really makes you wonder why people stay as well - probably the brand. 4. Vague / difficult to follow policies and insensitive internal operations staff. There’s a mass of internal policies and processes that are constantly changing and completely spread out across far too many systems. It’s often a case that you have to fight HR / internal policy teams to get things done or convince them your problem is real - the default position is that you are wrong / a time waster. Examples of internal operations issues: being paid the wrong amounts after a promotion and having to prove to HR that you’re entitled to the pay rise, expense policies in different systems that conflict with one another, offshore expense reviewers incorrectly rejecting expenses where you included detailed references to the expenses policy clauses, conflicting information in personal independence policies. Basically, you are expected to be the one to show them their policies after digging through all the internal and sometimes conflicting systems (see 2 above) or else they won’t budge! CULTURE: 5. Grievances not actioned. Grievances are always acknowledged but rarely followed up on. There is a general culture of ""suck it up [to aim for partner] or leave"" - there is not much of a middle ground encouraged and many people do leave when they find out not much seems to change, especially when it’s a people issue. 6. Leadership are distant. Leadership are rarely around ""on team"" and so team issues are often left to middle management who are often too busy or unwilling to deal with any people issues and this has contributed to many people leaving / low morale. Large procurement decisions are made with minimal consultation, which is also acknowledged then ignored e.g. “I see your point, but we’re doing this anyway” (see also point 2, technology). 7. Siloed working culture. Many teams are not willing to work together (e.g. pool resources, share experience) and it often means inefficient working and/or lower quality work and it’s really frustrating to be told by higher ups that you shouldn’t call in the specialist(s). 8. Extreme favouritism. Despite internal initiatives to ensure people are allocated work fairly, this is not the case in practice, with many people choosing their favourites which can be demoralising to those with less specific experience or those who have transferred from other teams.",2.0,"Current Employee, more than 3 years"

NA,3 Apr 2019,"Undervalued, Hypocrisy, Lack of Management. AVOID OPERATE",Mobile Analyst - Operate,"Belfast, Northern Ireland",None. Not a single one.,"- If offered a job. REJECT. - Aim High 2020 is a joke. Attended a half day seminar to explain mission statement ‘Aim High’. Sat listening to Brian O’Driscoll for 3 hours and came away none the wiser as to what we were aiming for. A grand slam we all joked. - Operate is a failing business, I put down to management (more follows). PwC are crimping employee benefits and restricting expenses. Namely due to losing contacts and trying to save money to maintain year on year ‘growth’. - Rapid expansion has created a team in excess of 1000. Most of the time you won’t be on a project you will be on the ‘bench’. Which used to be an actual bench but now if you’re lucky represents a hot desk if you can find one. - No structure in company. Never told how long your project or engagement will last, where you will go next. Impossible to plan your own personal life. Very lonely existence will follow acceptance of a job offer. - No professional training opportunities outside of Prince2. No progression opportunities or ability to transfer to other parts of PwC or other office locations. Complete lack of flexibility. - If you are based away from your base office you will be placed into accommodation, sharing with someone you have never met. This accommodation will be changed often so DO NOT get comfortable. - Management team who can’t organise anything. They will regularly ask for repeated information such as your Mobile number despite the management sitting next to each other and it being available on your employee profile and signature. Note: This is a work mobile number THEY gave me and has happened to numerous people on my project. - No expense structure when working away from base office. Have to guess. Sometimes they get approved sometimes they do not. Asked a PwC manager for the expense policy twice and got laughed at. - No training provided. Spent two days in office before being shipped to client site. After 2 years yet to hear from the office. You become a number and nothing more. - Performance reviews every 6 months is a joke. The form required to be filled out every 6 months constantly changes. Performance review is based off a senior associate’s 3 minute pitch to management about what you have done. This could be despite you having never worked with them or met them. Asinine. - - My first performance review was after 8 months due to joining cycle. At this review they believed I had been in the company one month. And received no remuneration increase. When I explained it was 8 months the balked and looked sheepishly into their papers. I was promoted on the next cycle despite doing nothing additional or different. Feel this was out of embarrassment. - New ‘Gems’ system was introduced recently to award your colleagues. No one uses it and those who do have reciprocal agreements to earn themselves an extra fiver every month. - Pay is arbitrarily set. There is no structure to who is paid what in this company. If you are liked / known and try to leave they will try and offer you money to stay, never addressing your grievances or reasons for wanting to leave. - The quitting process was laughable. Resigned online (through portal), emailed two managers and thought I was done. Contacted by two different managers (remember they all sit together in the same office) asking what it is I do, where I am located and what project I am on. This is after TWO years of being on said project and going through three supposed performance reviews.

People cheat the process by getting performance reviews from ""buddies"". If the feedback does not come from a Partner, or from an influential Director, it does not count. Also, it's tacitly accepted that one shouldn't really say any real development areas in their feedback. e.g. I was once given really good feedback, but this person didn't include any 'development' points in it because ""they would use it against me in moderation"". - A culture that rewards wrong/less valuable behaviours: visibility and popularity is much more important than quality of delivery. It almost looks like quality, techical acumen, are very low in their scale. - At least in my experience I had two very unenthusiastic and untrustworthy People Managers. They completely set me up for failure when not being transparent about the culture of the firm mentioned above. - Pay is the lowest amongst the Big 4s, pretty tough to live in London with PwC salaries. But the talent and work is in London, so they should try to pay for it. Sad bonus scheme, and zero chance of getting a payrise if you don't get promoted. - Greedy: The UK Partnership is among the most profitable of the PwC firms. This is on the expense of low pay to staff. How can they justify that the Avg Partner profit is 12 times a Mgrs salary? It's also around 6-7x a Director's salary. Is a Partner's value added 6-7x of what a Director brings? I am not sure. While Partners are in general hard working individuals, most of their role is Sales. Is an experienced Sales person paid 6-7x times more than a delivery person in other companies? Don't get me wrong, all Partners are in general fairly well experienced leaders that definitely made it there for a reason. I just think they could adjust their disposable income to level de staff's pay with the market. Surely they are not in PwC just for the money? (At least that's what they preach to staff)",3.0,"Former Employee, more than 3 years"

NA,14 Mar 2018,Disappointing throughout,Management,"London, England","In general, PwC does a good job in taking graduates and putting them through a structured training programme, regardless whether you’re an auditor or on some other pathway. Very senior management are finally getting that non-audit assurance work – particularly in technology areas – is going to be vital to help balance the loss of traditional, endless audit engagements. The firm has a good vision and likes to think that it is different to the other Big 4 by caring for its staff - but the poor implementation of that vision and of the people-related values is where things fall apart.","An individual’s experience of life at PwC is entirely down to the whims of the particular partner or the area of the organisation in which they find themselves. The partnership model and the ‘Partner is God’ mentality means that the UK firm can feel like it’s riven with internal feuding and middle management careerism, especially in new technology areas. The demand for rapid growth from the senior leadership has led to a mass import of new partners, none of whom have been exposed to, or perhaps care enough, about the ‘people values’ that PwC claims to espouse. The firm does a terrible job integrating experienced hires, especially those at Manager, Senior Manager and Director level. Those factors are leading to low morale, a level of stress & anxiety related sick leave that I’ve never seen in any organisation, and a level of staff turnover that’s surprising and/or worrying – despite the laudable vision of wanting to be the ‘go to’ organisation for new technology assurance. All organisations can expect a level of staff attrition, but when the younger graduates and ‘star performers’ are leaving barely three years in (and going to the competition), it’s clear that peoples’ day-to-day experience of working in the firm is far from positive. Issues have been identified but nothing concrete is being done about it. No one leaves a firm because the Knowledge Management system is rubbish or the coffee is too expensive. But if their day to day experience is poor; if the level of feedback is shocking - one quote from a Director to their team was: “You need to make this less [expletive deleted]”; if middle management (Senior Managers and Directors) stop focusing on an excellent client experience and spend their time developing their internal network and their own careers; if a ‘banter culture’ persists (leaving men and women in tears)…..then the cycle of recruitment/disillusionment/turnover is going to continue.",3.0,"Former Employee, more than 5 years"

NA,7 Nov 2015,Support service faces Dowton Abbey style culture,Resource Manager,"London, England","Great name to have on your CV, nice to work in such a big organisation, but that does have its own cons. A young motivated workforce.","Unfortunately working in a support function does not bring with it the same advantages as being client facing staff. Hence my title, support staff are treated as the help under the stairs. Opinions are rarely asked for, and most concerning is when things do not go as they should, the business tries to get client facing staff to sort it out, as if they are the only ones with brains in their heads. The only advantage of this is they then see how challenging the roles of resource management can be. The most frustrating thing to me was the fact that our support function, which was resource management, had to ensure that our BU facilitated business unit staff to go away on secondments and get on the right jobs for promotion. However none of these perks were available to my staff. The boost that would have given the teams if they could go away on secondment for a few months would have been immeasurable. But unfortunately it was seen as far too difficult even to allow a swap of offices for a few months for a change of perspective. The biggest downside to PWC is the lack of leadership, individuals confuse leadership with management. There are some technically fantastic people who know their stuff and as such can manage activity very well. However brave tenacious and inspirational leadership was seriously lacking, I would even be moved to say a lot of senior people had an air of cowardice about them, which I know sounds harsh but I think in some areas it is fair. The BU I worked in looked after their people very poorly leading to many people leaving. Admittedly there were a few managers who took the role of mentoring and supporting their people seriously and worked hard to develop the people and teams under them, but they were few and far between. Unfortunately due to the matrix environment individuals performing poorly were in a large number of cases, someone else’s responsibility.

They have great experience and what I call technical knowledge and best of all they are willing to share it with you. 2. Training is brilliant, this firm has one of the best graduate programmes for management consultants and offers excellent learning and development throughout your career. 3. Due to the massive nature of the firm it is very hard to get sacked unless you do something stupid e.g. Sexual harassment, racism, etc. there is so much red tape that you get several chances before being shown the door. Also the firm competes within itself, so you could feasibly move from consulting to risk assurance and do the same job - but with new people managing you. 4. If you want international experience - secondments are readily available. 5. If you can navigate the Cons I have listed the world really is your oyster and you will have a good experience here.","Please note that this point of view is based on working in Advisory/Consulting in the UK bean counter competency (if you don't know what that means it doesn't apply to you). 1. On joining the firm make sure you are happy with your grade and compensation package, as there is a good chance you will not get a pay rise or bonus for the next five years. 2. Expanding on the above - you are judged every year on utilisation, developing others, extra time you spend on developing collateral and what you've done to raise the firms profile e.g. Charity work in the community, article in the paper, etc. NO ONE will tell you this explicitly when you join the business. Working on a project and hitting your billable hours a year is only a small part of it. You are judged against the ENTIRE competency on a 1 - 4 scale, with only 1s and 2s getting a pay rise every year and even these numbers are bell curved. Meeting your util target will get you a 3 at most, if you haven't worked the extra ours to cover the other areas your performance is reviewed against. 3. People managers hold your career in the palm of your hands, they are the ones that attend moderation on your behalf and argue your case. If you don't have one that cares, then your career is over. Also unless your PM is a high flier you are going no where. Last year I asked my PM what I had to do to get at least a 2. I worked my socks off and did everything he told me - we had regular monthly catch ups to make sure I was on target. Then it came to year end and I didn't get a 2, whereas the other 2 people he managed got 1s. I was livid, how could he not even benchmark my year against the others? I brought this up in my appraisal and all I got was a pat on the head and better luck next time. 4. Despite what they tell you Partner and Director sponsorship is everything. If you aren't ""in"" with a clique you are going no where, usually your PM will get you into theirs but it doesn't always work that way. In this firm alone there is the ex-Dolittle gang, IP boys club, FS master group and R&C mafia. If you can't get into one of these areas and get Partner and Director support enjoy the no pay rise and bonus years. 5. In my area the firm scores 0 for diversity, all the Partners are WASPs aged between 40 - 60. This is a fact and whilst they are trying to change this nothing has happened since my time here. 6. Good eggs with great experience and technical knowledge are leaving in droves or moving to other areas within the firm. The lack of progression from C to SC and from SC to Director has caused this. There have been too many broken promises and false starts, is it any wonder that of all of the Big 4 this firm have had open recruitment during all of the lean years? 7. Due to how the business has grown, some people have joined the firm without going through the promotion process at a higher level than they were previously at. I am constantly amazed at how little content these people have and just talk their way through meetings, not realising that they are out of their depth.",1.0,"Current Employee, more than 5 years"

NA,5 Sept 2010,Forced into a dead end,Director,"London, England",Big projects - good brand name on CV,Got branded into a particular dead end area by a management that needed somebody to plug that particular sector/skill. I tried to break out of it but was told bluntly that I could not. I ended up being used as an expert on lots of different projects and actively prevented from taking control/leadership in said projects. The company does not understand how to use centralized resource and costs. There was no recognition for my experience prior to PWC which was different to the skill set that management forced me to develop. PWC's value to client is limited due to charge out rates. The Consultants are more or less prohibited from telling the client anything controversial. There is a strong incentive to limit the use of expertise from other parts of the firm so that the revenue and chargeable hours go to the local P&L. They don't promote experienced hires or give credit for previous career experience. It is luck as to whether one gets noticed and supported by senior management.,2.0,Former Employee

Having worked in a larger office and a smaller office, I can say that the cameraderie in the smaller office was far better. A wide range of work opportunities is available, with the potential for global mobility too. Pay is reasonable and holiday seems quite good - 25 days with the opportunity to buy or sell an extra week. There's also an additional day at Christmas that is given, so it's possible to have 39 days off in a year (30 days + 1 day at Christmas + 8 bank holidays). There is lots of scope for flexible working, as long as the job gets done.","Progression brings extra reward, which is considerable towards the top of the tree, but in the middle it doesn't seem adequate compensation for all the extra hours spent at work. As would undoubtedly be the same with any large professional services company, it's not very good for people who want to stay still and not progress any further up the career ladder. The unwritten message could be summarised as 'upwards or out'. The annual objectives process is quite onerous and is often not very helpful.

NA,22 Jun 2010,Career at PwC,Senior Associate,"London, England","There is great flexibility at PwC - as you progress you have the freedom (as an assurance assoicate at least) to pretty much work your own hours, depending on the engagement.

Additionally, the people you work with are very good in general - they are pleasant and well mannered, and well educated.","The flexibility described above can be a double edged sword - there are times when it's taken for granted that you will take your laptop home with you and continue to work from home, or at the weekends, in order to meet some ridiculous deadlines on an understaffed job. The work/life balance seems to elude many managers and senior managers at PwC who assume that you will work all the hours god sends.

Great place to pick up some soft skills, as you are in contact with clients every day.","The work gets very repetitive and boring after a few months, by the end of your 3 year training contract you will not be as clever or as sharp as when you came out of uni, and this may hinder your future job prospects. My advice for people thinking of using PwC as a stepping stone to move into IB or investment management would be to make sure you do some extra reading on the side and not get sucked into audit too much. Feedback process is a joke. People who are rated highly are the ones who either work on the large busy season clients (where you are probably working until 12am) or the ones whose managers can be bothered to write anything. Way too much jumping through hoops and it is difficult to gain recognition if you are not working on the right clients. But the worst thing about working at PwC is that there is absolutely no incentive to go the extra mile, e.g. if you finish an audit early on a smaller client and ask the manager for extra work, most of the time you will get bits of admin work and photocopying, etc. When it comes to review time, your timesheet will show that you have been doing nothing for a few days and this will work against your utilisation.

NA,1 Sept 2008,PwC offers a great deal of opportunities and is a fantastic training ground.,Audit Senior Associate,"London, England","The people and the opportunities available throughout the firm. There are some great people in management, however there are few people who are pushed out of the firm so there is some variation in management, and often the best people are far too stretched as a result. There are huge opportunities there for the taking if you are prepared to commit yourself, such as secondments and varied work. PwC also offers a fantastic level of training, the first 2 years being a great learning curve.","Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent. Also, bonuses in audit do not reflect the level of work, and there is huge disparity across the amount of hours worked which I don't feel is appropriately rewarded.",4.0,Current Employee
NA,23 Aug 2008,"PwC Audit, London",Assurance Senior Associate,"Saint Albans, England","Variety of clients, good study support, exit opportunities are good at the end of your training contract.",Unless you're one of the 'chosen few' viewed as partner material then you're basically treated as expendable-the staff turnover is extremely high. The system is very 'one size fits all' and promotion is based more on politics than on any form of demonstrable performance. The hours are also excessive (60+) and there is a culture of not charging time which allows senior management to stick their heads in the sand and claim no-ones working long hours.,3.0,Current Employee

NA,22 Jun 2008,PwC is worldwide and you can feel a little lost in it. If you find your way it is a good place to settle,Manager,"London, England","Big company so you have opportunities if you want to find them, if you are the type of person who goes after such opportunities you will love working for PwC. It is a challenging place to work and that makes each day different and enjoyable.","You can feel a little like a number and a role rather than a person. It is a very large organization and can feel lost, nervous about making mistakes and like you are living in a foreign country without knowing the language for sometime! There are expectations that you will live and breathe PwC, so you might have to fight to get the balance you want - it is there for the strong!",4.0,Current Employee
NA,19 Jun 2008,Come and prepare to be challenged,Senior Manager,"London, England",What initially attracts you to the Firm is it's Brand name credibility. As things go on you find yourself with a massive range of opportunities in every area you could possible imagine and a few that you would never have thought of in a million years. It is a firm where you are 2 calls away from the answer to anything because you either know someone who knows or they know someone who knows. It is also a place where you can have fun at the same time as you are making a difference where some of the projects can transform organisations.,Sometimes you can end up in a valuable role with very limited advancement opportunities,4.0,Current Employee
